Introduction
1

This document is a guide for implementing the standard adopted by the ICH for electronic
transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) according to the ICH E2B(R3) message
standard. This Implementation Guide (IG) was jointly developed by the ICH E2B(R3) and M2 Expert
Working Groups (EWGs). The E2B(R3) EWG provided business requirements and the M2 EWG provided
technical content for this IG. These two EWGs were reconstituted as the ICH E2B(R3) EWG in
November 2010.
Conceptually, an ICSR is a report of information describing adverse event(s) / reaction(s) experienced
by an individual patient. The event(s)/reaction(s) can be related to the administration of one or more
medicinal products at a particular point in time. The ICSR can also be used for exchange of other
information, such as medication error(s) that do not involve adverse events(s)/reaction(s).
This ICH IG focuses on medicinal products and therapeutic biologics for human use. However, the ICH
is aware of other regional applications of the messaging standard that have a wider scope, such as
pharmacovigilance activities related to vaccines, herbal products, cosmetics, veterinary products or
medical devices. The primary ICH application is for the exchange of pharmacovigilance information
between and among the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities.
This IG is also intended to support the implementation of software and tools for creating, editing,
sending and receiving electronic ICSR messages.
This IG is not intended to serve as a reference for proper pharmacovigilance practices nor is it intended
to explain the underlying scientific or medical issues that support the collation, categorisation or
analysis of medicinal product safety information. It is also not intended to explain the rationale that
underlies proper case safety reporting.
The focus of this ICH IG is on technical implementation. Thus, the intended audience includes system
developers, IT professionals, system implementers and system users who need to understand the
technical requirements for constructing and using valid electronic messages to transmit ICSRs. This IG
provides the information necessary to support the development of adequate informatics tools (e.g.
forms and interfaces for end user data entry) as well as technical requirements to design style sheets,
conduct data transformations and code well-formed messages. However, this IG does not provide or
infer guidance or recommendations for any particular database technology or software platform.
Instead, this IG describes the technical requirement to generate valid XML code according to the
standard outlined in this IG.
Subsequent sections of this IG provide explanatory text concerning the business context for electronic
ICSR messaging, including ICH documentation, and application to pharmacovigilance transactions.

1. Purpose
The business objective of this ICH IG is to standardise the definition of the data elements used in the
electronic transmission of different types of ICSRs, regardless of source and destination. This IG
describes data elements for ICSRs for both the pre- and post-authorisation periods, and addresses
both adverse drug reaction reports and adverse event reports. The technical objective of this IG is to
assist reporters and recipients (including pharmaceutical companies, regulatory authorities and noncommercial sponsors) in implementing systems to construct transmittable ICSR messages. The

representation of the ICSR follows an international standard that is platform-, application-, and
vendor-independent.

1.1. Scope
The representation of the ICSR in this IG, in its format and content, is made up of a large number of
data elements, allowing precise reporting of medical content to most business partners, including
regulatory authorities. For example, the data elements and their format are suitable to describe
several types of case reports including those without adverse events or adverse reactions, such as
medicinal product administration during pregnancy, overdose, medication error, or potential lack of
efficacy. Therefore, in order to maintain the integrity and usability of the standard, requests for
inclusion of additional local data should not be necessary and should be avoided as much as possible.
The scope of this IG for the ICH E2B (R3) ICSR does not include the definition of database structures,
the design of a paper report form, quality control/quality assurance aspects, or technical security
issues.

1.2. Business Case
Because of national and international agreements, rules, regulations, and the protection of patient
safety, there is a need to expedite the exchange of safety information (e.g. ICSRs):


from identified reporting sources to regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies;



between regulatory authorities;



between pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities;



between pharmaceutical companies;



from clinical investigators, via the sponsor of a clinical trial, to ethics committees; or



from authorities to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centres for International
Drug Monitoring.

The exchange of safety information is based on paper-based formats (e.g. Yellow Cards, CIOMS I
forms, MedWatch forms, etc.) or electronic media (e.g. on-line access, tape, CD, etc). Considering the
large number of potential participants in a world-wide exchange of information, there should be a
standard format that is capable of accommodating direct database-to-database transmission using
standardised message transfers. Successful electronic transmission of information relies on the
consistent and uniform interpretation of definitions for common data elements and standard
transmission procedures, such as those provided in this document.
Over the last decade as the number of case reports has increased, exchange of ICSRs has increasingly
shifted from paper-based to electronic reports and electronic transmission of case safety information
has become an important component of global pharmacovigilance. The ICH released a consensus
electronic standard for ICSRs in 1997 and this standard has undergone a number of revisions since it
was first adopted. The ICH E2B(R2) standard has been used for regulatory compliance purposes for
several years and, indeed, is now mandatory in some ICH regulatory jurisdictions and is widely
accepted.
Development of the standard described in this IG represents a change of the ICH process, as the
messaging standard was developed through a partnership with external Standards Development
Organisations (SDOs).Prior to the message standard described in this IG, ICH electronic messaging
standards were developed by the ICH M2 EWG for Electronic Standards for the Transmission of

Regulatory Information(ESTRI).Specifically, the current message standard was developed through a
collaborative relationship between the ICH and the Joint Initiative Council (JIC); the JIC is a
partnership of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), the Health Level Seven (HL7),
the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the Clinical Data Interchange Standards
Consortium (CDISC), the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation
(IHTSDO), and GS12. The ICSR standard named ‘ISO / HL7 27953-2: 2011 Health informatics -Individual case safety reports (ICSRs) in pharmacovigilance -- Part 2: Human pharmaceutical reporting
requirements for ICSR’ is available at the ISO website (http://www.iso.org/iso/store.htm).

2. Background
2.1. General background and history of ICH
2.1.1. The ICH and its partners
The ICH was organised to provide a consensus forum for tripartite harmonisation initiatives to be
developed with input from both regulatory and pharmaceutical industry representatives. The primary
focus of the ICH is to harmonise some of the technical requirements for the registration of
pharmaceutical products among Japan, the European Union (EU)and the United States(US).The six ICH
Parties in those three regions are the European Commission for the EU, the European Federation of
Pharmaceutical Industries’ Associations (EFPIA), the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, Japan
(MHLW) / the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), the Japan Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association (JPMA), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). The International Federation of
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA) serves as ICH Secretariat. The World Health
Organisation (WHO), Health Canada and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) participate in the
ICH as observers. Governance of ICH is via a Steering Committee, composed of representatives of the
six ICH Parties and the Observers.
In addition to the above, the ICH supports a Global Cooperation Group (GCG), which has
representatives from the six ICH Parties, the three Observers, and the Secretariat, as well as
representatives from other Regional Harmonisation Initiatives (RHIs) for pharmaceutical regulation,
namely the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), the Pan American Network on Drug Regulatory
Harmonization (PANDRH) and the South African Development Community (SADC).
This IG applies to the safety reporting requirements for medicinal products in the three main ICH
regions: Japan, the EU, and the US, as well as in those regions that are ICH Observers or are working
with ICH through the auspices of the GCG.
Further information about ICH, its EWGs and standards, and supporting documentation is available
from the ICH website. Other technical information specific for the testing and implementation of the
technical standards is made available by the ICH M2 EWG, and can also be found at the ICH web site.

2.1.2 History of ICH ICSR guidelines
The first ICH E2B guideline, Data Elements for Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports, was
endorsed on July 17, 1997.It was modified in November 2000, and then published with minor editorial
changes in February 2001 as the ICH Step 4 E2B (M) guideline. As part of an ICH document
management initiative, the Step 4 E2B (M) guideline was retitled as the E2B (R2) guideline in May
2

GS1 is an international not-for-profit association dedicated to the design and implementation of global standards and
solutions to improve the efficiency and visibility of supply and demand chains globally and across sectors.

2005; there was no change in business content. The ICH M2 EWG prepared the Electronic Transmission
of Individual Case Safety Reports Message Specification guideline in 2001 to standardise the data
elements for the electronic transmission of ICSRs by identifying and defining the core elements for an
ICSR, regardless of source or destination.

2.1.3 The process of revision in ICH
Considering the high volume of data and the large number of potential participants involved with the
world-wide exchange of safety information, there is an ongoing need for efficient transmission of safety
reports in a format that can be generated and processed nearly automatically by a transactional
database. This need has led to periodic revisions of the E2B document, as described in Section 2.1.2
(above). The E2B(R3) message represents an iteration of the electronic ICSR that has evolved in a
controlled fashion over more than a decade.
Successful electronic transmission of ICSRs relies on standard common data elements and syntactical
definition of the electronic message. Therefore, the adoption of a standardised electronic message
across regions, regulatory agencies, and other participants is of paramount importance. In 2006, the
ICH decided to pursue an alternative model for the development of the third revision of E2B that
engaged SDOs. This IG describes the messaging standard for the implementation of the E2B(R3)
message developed through this new process.
In order to broaden the ICH’s outreach and be able to develop a global, harmonised and
implementable electronic messaging standard, the ICH Steering Committee, which is the body that
governs the ICH, made a decision to align its development efforts with SDOs. The ISO, HL7, CEN,
CDISC and IHTSDO, along with their respective technical committees (TCs) and stakeholders for health
informatics standardisation, have collectively identified an opportunity to collaborate, coordinate, and
cooperate so their efforts will support the creation of global electronic health informatics standards that
can be integrated into the broader healthcare environment.
To that end, the SDOs noted above have formed a Joint Initiative to address and resolve issues of
gaps, overlaps, and counter-productive standardisation efforts through an agreed-upon decision
process. Governance of the Joint Initiative is via a Joint Initiative Council (JIC), which has
representation from each member SDO. This approach facilitates a single best standard for each
problem with mutual recognition and endorsement of standards by participating SDOs. For the ICH,
working with SDOs to leverage resources for electronic standards development and avoid overlapping,
counter-productive, or counter-acting standards is critical to achieving and maintaining its own
harmonisation goals.

2.2. Development of ICSR standard under Joint initiative
The ICH’s original New Work Item Proposal to ISO for the ICSR standard was accepted as an ISO
Project activity, ISO 27953, and was subsequently endorsed as a Joint Initiative project in February
2008. The ICSR standard was considered a candidate for SDO harmonisation because of global interest
in improving patient safety through the electronic exchange of unambiguous, structured data to
support regulatory and patient safety needs.
The ISO 27953 consolidates content and messaging specifications based on ISO New Work Item
Proposal N545 (Pharmacovigilance - Structure and Data Elements of Individual Case Safety Report),
HL7 ICSR Release 1 Normative Standard, and HL7 ICSR Release 2 Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU).
The ICSR standard was developed through the ISO ballot process, Draft International Standard, Final
Draft International Standard, and International Standard (IS). The standard was published by ISO as
the IS in November 2011.

2.3. Background of message standard
The HL7 version 3 (V3) messaging standard deals with a static model of health care information as
viewed within the scope of HL7 standards development activities.ISO recognises HL7 as an accredited
partnering organisation for mutually issuing standards. The first mutually published standard was
ISO/HL7 21731:2006 Health informatics -- HL7 version 3 -- Reference Information Model -- Release
3
1. HL7 V3 was developed to address the complex needs of health information technology. The HL7
Reference Information Model (RIM) is the cornerstone of HL7 V3 and the essential model from which
all HL7 messages are derived. The RIM defines data content needed in a specific context and provides
an explicit representation of the semantic and lexical connections that exist between the information
carried in the elements of a message. HL7 V3 supports development of specifications that facilitate
interoperability between systems. The HL7 model-driven methodology is used to develop consensusbased standards for healthcare system interoperability and information exchange.HL7 V3 messages are
based on an XML encoding syntax. To learn more about HL7 V3, refer to ‘Understanding Version 3: A
primer on the HL7 Version 3 Healthcare Interoperability Standard – Normative Edition,’ by Andrew
Hinchley. The ISO / HL7 27953-2 standard is built upon the Health Level 7 (HL7) ICSR Release 3
standard (or HL7 ICSR R3).The HL7 ICSR R3 standard is a particular message based on the HL7 V3.
A framework of ICSR standard published as ‘ISO / HL7 27953-1:2011 Health informatics -- Individual
case safety reports (ICSRs) in pharmacovigilance -- Part 1: Framework for adverse event reporting’
supports message transmissions in drugs, medical devices, veterinary drugs, cosmetic, and dietary
supplements. The ICH E2B (R3) message standard is founded on the ISO / HL7 27953-2 standard,
which is constrained from ISO / HL7 27953-1to provide an ‘ICH sub-set’ of the standard supporting
electronic messaging for the ICH E2B(R3) data elements. Although this standard is the ‘ICH sub-set’, it
can be applied to regions and business cases beyond the narrower use described in this ICH
E2B(R3)IG. Elements of the ISO / HL7 27953-2 standard which solely relate to use cases outside the
remit of ICH will not be addressed within this document. Detailed information about ISO/HL7

27953-2 can be obtained from ISO web site:
http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store.htm.
2.4. Representation of the electronic ICSR
2.4.1. Why standardisation and electronic ICSR exchange are needed
ICSRs are exchanged primarily to enhance patient safety thereby promoting public health.
Furthermore, ICSRs need to be transmitted across stakeholder communities throughout the health
product lifecycle, during clinical investigation as well as for continued safety monitoring once
authorised for marketing. Electronic reporting facilitates the transfer of information and makes safety
data readily available for further processing and analysis. These advantages allow regulators, MAHs,
healthcare professionals (HCPs) and consumers to make better-informed decisions regarding the use of
health products.
Without harmonization, the existence of a multiplicity of message and/or content standards across
regions and regulatory jurisdictions would result in diseconomies of scale and increase the burden for
reporters. A lack of harmonisation might lead to difficulties in reconciling ICSRs on the global level. A
harmonised standard should stimulate vendors to develop ‘off-the-shelf’ tools that are interoperable
due to the standard itself. A harmonised standard will also help maximise forward compatibility of data
and minimise the complexities of backward compatibility. For these reasons, health authorities and the

pharmaceutical industry are moving in unison toward a meaningful, harmonised standard for use by all
constituents.

2.4.2. How ICSRs are presently transmitted and the advantages of
electronic submissions
To support the ICH E2B guideline, the ICH M2 EWG published the ‘Electronic Transmission of Individual
Case Safety Reports Message Specification (ICH ICSR DTD Version 2.1), Final Version 2.3’ in February
of 2001. At that time, prior work on the standardisation of an electronic message by HL7 and EDIFACT
(Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport) was considered, but the
ICH selected SGML (Standard Generalised Markup Language, ISO 8879:1986) as the preferred
alternative because SGML was the de facto standard for the interchange of information. SGML also
supported the multi-lingual character sets needed across ICH regions.
In spite of this fact, the SGML-based DTD (Document Type Definition) approach is no longer the
optimal solution. As a result, the current messaging standard herein now relies upon XML schemas.
The reasoning is explained below.
2.4.2.1. Markup languages4
First published in 1988, Standard Generalised Markup Language (SGML) is an ISO standard (ISO 8879)
designed to describe the structure and content of electronic documents, with an original purpose of
enabling the exchange of electronic documents between business entities that need information to be
available for extended periods of time (archived).It serves as a basis for eXtensibleMarkup Language
(XML), which is simpler than SGML yet maintains the most useful parts of SGML.
SGML requires that structured documents reference a Document Type Definition (DTD) to be valid. The
DTD is the tool used to create and describe the expected SGML or XML. Simply, a DTD specifies the
syntax (the elements, attributes, entities, and notations) required in a document authored in SGML or
XML. Once a DTD is created and a document is written based on that DTD, the document is then
compared to the DTD. This is referred to as validation. If the document follows the rules listed in the
DTD, then the document is said to be valid. SGML/XML documents that do not follow the rules in their
DTDs are categorised as invalid.
The DTD specifies the required structure and format of a particular document.XML is more flexible than
SGML and allows for the concept of ‘well-formed’ data – content that meets the basic vocabulary and
‘grammatical’ requirements of XML but does not reference a DTD for a specific set of attributes or list
of required elements.XML contains a further concept called a schema. An XML schema introduces both
the ability to apply more complex constraints and the ability to have more flexibility in well-formed
data.
In general, DTDs perform well when applied to documents or text-intensive information.XML schema
5
work best for data-intensive information . One challenge with DTDs is that they represent two different
things at the same time: a grammar and a schema. Because XML syntax is ‘fixed’, it does not need
‘grammar’ to properly access the information content. In addition, XML schemas can be manipulated,
6

stored, and indexed, which is a practical advantage .

Another advantage to XML is that Unicode is universally present in all XML parsers. Except for more
7
recent ones, most SGML parsers do not provide Unicode support . Unicode provides a ‘unique’ code (a
number) for each character. Thus, characters are represented in an abstract way while the visual
rendering (size, shape, font or style) is left to other applications, such as a web browser or word
8
processor. In this way, translation between languages is built into the use of XML .
2.4.2.2. Advantages to electronic submissions
The ICH chose to adopt an XML schema for the ICSR as it is more suitable for the intended purpose:
XML is portable and non-proprietary. It can be used to store and share information electronically
across platforms. XML is used for encapsulating information to be passed between two computing
systems which might otherwise be unable to communicate. It provides a common envelope for interprocess communication (messaging). It is supported by an international standard and will, therefore,
9

remain accessible .
The ICH ICSR enhances electronic adverse event reporting and analysis by facilitating the efficient
reporting of suspected product-related adverse events/reactions. The electronic environment:


improves the ability to efficiently exchange and process ICSR data;



facilitates the transfer of information to organisations who need it;



enables incoming messages to be automatically routed and processed;



facilitates aggregation of safety data for analysis; and



allows minimising resources required for data (re-)entry activities.

3. Essential components
Developing software specifications to support business needs, such as those specified in E2B(R3), calls
for an approach where the functional and procedural requirements are well understood and reflected
accurately in the electronic message. The electronic message must not only contain an accurate
definition of the data elements (XML schema), but also maintain any required relationships between
the elements for efficient information exchange. The development of relational diagrams, attribute
lists, numeric codes, and a constrained ICH ICSR schema are all parts of the process of developing the
software specifications to facilitate electronic transmission of ICSRs. The ICH ICSR message allows for
the preparation of adverse event/reaction data sets that can accurately maintain and represent the
intended purpose of the E2B(R3) document. Section 3 of this IG lists the exact E2B(R3) data elements
and essential components to develop usable and exchangeable ICH ICSR messages. Necessary
schemas for the ICH ICSR message are listed in Appendix I (A).

3.1. ICH ICSR relational diagrams
Figure 1 below illustrates the relationship between the main sections defined in E2B(R3) for the ICH
ICSR message and XML descriptors. Each box in the diagram represents a related section of the
E2B(R3) data element structure, and all the data elements in that block are listed in the attribute list
(Section 3.4).For example, box C.1 in the diagram Identification of the Case Safety Report represents

E2B(R3) data element list.
The E2B(R3) specification defines inter-relationships between data elements allowing for various
mandatory/required, optional, unique, or repeatable sections (information blocks).Relationships
between elements vary, as indicated by:



0 ...1 (unique and optional);



1 ...n (one to many and mandatory); or



0 ...n (one to many and optional).

Diagrams in Section 3.4 provide the next level of detail and are intended to help business users
understand how the various portions of the ICSR relate to one another, while helping application
developers understand how to populate an XML message designed and developed to meet the E2B(R3)
specification.

3.2. Code sets, terminologies and vocabularies for E2B(R3)
There are several terminologies and controlled vocabularies that are used to describe or code
information within an ICSR. Some of these terminologies or code sets are general and are used by
many applications, such as units for mass or time, or country codes. Others are specific to the medical

ICH guideline E2B (R3) on electronic transmission of individual case safety reports
(ICSRs) - data elements and message specification - implementation guide
EMA/CHMP/ICH/287/1995

Page 15/137

section, such as MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities).Still others are specific code lists
created for the ICH. This section will address the code sets, terminologies and vocabularies used in this
IG. Specific guidance is provided in Section 3.4 for each individual element.
Although the technical specifications for the code sets (e.g. Data Types) are provided in Section 3.4,
these are current as of printing this IG. Specifications may evolve over time to adapt to new
technologies and new business needs. Ultimately, the validation specifications of code sets (e.g.
technical format and values allowed) are defined by the organisation that maintains the terminology,
and those organisations should be consulted to obtain the most current specifications for their code
sets.
Code set specifications (e.g. technical format and values allowed) are defined by
the organisation that maintains the terminology. As they may evolve at a
different pace than the publication of this IG, those organisations should be
consulted to obtain their most current specifications.
An Object Identifier (OID) is a sequence of numbers to uniquely identify an object. The numbers
represent a hierarchically-assigned namespace, formally defined using the International
Telecommunications Union ASN.1 standard. These numbers are written either as a string of digits
separated by dots or as a list of named ‘branches.’ For example, the MedDRA dictionary of terms is
identified by the OID 2.16.840.1.113883.6.163 which also represents the branch ‘joint-iso-itut.country.us.organisation.hl7.external-code-system.MedDRA’.
Organizations can obtain an OID by requesting an identifier from a registrar, and, if it desires, an
organisation can in turn become a registrar and subsequently generate child OIDs to its internal
objects. The ICH is implementing OIDs to identify code systems used in ICSR message exchange.
Tables 1 through 7 in this section of the IG list all the OIDs used to code the data elements of the ICH
ICSR. A list of OIDs registered by ICH is available on the ICH website. In addition to OIDs in the tables
1 to 7, some OIDs registered by HL7 are used in ICSR messages to differentiate the intended use of
some elements (e.g. in data elements F.r.4 and F.r.5 for normal values of test results, different OIDs
are used to differentiate between ‘low’ and ‘high’, respectively).Although those HL7 registered OIDs are
not described in the tables below, the reference instance in Appendix I (D) provides all OIDs in the
context they are used.

3.2.1. Terminologies and vocabularies employed by the ICSR message
3.2.1.1. ISO identification of medicinal products (IDMP)
In collaboration with the ICH M5 EWG, ISO developed a set of standards to enhance exchange of
information for medicinal products. These include identifiers to allow mapping of international
terminologies for routes of administration, dosage forms and units of measurement, as well as
controlled identifiers to enable cross-border identification of pharmaceutical products and mapping to
their core components, e.g. substances.
The ICH M5 Implementation Guide for the IDentification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) will be available
after this IG is published. The ISO IDMP standards, the basis for this ICH M5 IG, include:


ISO 11238 Health informatics － Identification of medicinal products－Data elements and structures
for the unique identification and exchange of regulated information on substances



ISO 11239 Health Informatics － Identification of medicinal products －Data elements and
structures for the unique identification and exchange of regulated information on pharmaceutical
dose forms, units of presentation, routes of administration and packaging

The data elements that use the ICH M5 IDMP vocabularies are described in Section 3.4 of this
document. However, where ICH M5 IDMP terms and/or identifiers (e.g. codes) are not available, the IG
provides instructions for alternate meanings to code the information until the availability of the ICH M5
IG.
Until the M5 controlled vocabularies for the IDMP are available, temporary rules
are applied to the data elements. Terms and identifiers (codes) may be provided
by each region until the standard M5 IDMP controlled vocabularies are
implemented.

3.2.1.2. MedDRA - the medical dictionary for regulatory activities
MedDRA® - the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities - is a medical terminology used to classify
adverse event information associated with the use of biopharmaceuticals and other medical products
(e.g. medical devices and vaccines). Coding these data to a standard set of MedDRA terms allows
health authorities and the biopharmaceutical industry to more readily exchange and analyze data
related to the safe use of medical products11.
MedDRA trademark is owned by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and
Associations (IFPMA) on behalf of ICH, and MedDRA was developed by the ICH. The MSSO Maintenance and Support Services Organization - serves as the repository, maintainer, and distributor
10

These will be replaced with the registered OID reference when it is available.
This description of MedDRA is taken from the webpage of the MSSO at http://www.meddramsso.com/. For more

of MedDRA as well as the source for the most up-to-date information regarding MedDRA and its
application within the biopharmaceutical industry and regulators. MedDRA subscribers submit proposed
changes to the terminology. The MSSO includes a group of internationally based physicians who review
all proposed subscriber changes and provide a timely response directly to the requesting subscriber.
The ICH ICSR utilises MedDRA to code a number of medical concepts, such as adverse reactions or
events, indications for drug use, medical history, etc. The following elements require MedDRA coding at
the Lowest Level Term (LLT).Please note that only one version of MedDRA can be used in a single
ICSR.

There is one exception not included in the table above. The identifier used in the ‘Sender's (case)
Safety Report Unique Identifier’ (C.1.1) and the ‘Worldwide Unique Case Identification Number’
(C.1.8.1), is not listed as it is not exclusively coded using ISO 3166 Part 1.Nevertheless, it does
reference the ISO Country Code system in its construction; see the user guidance for C.1.1 for more
details.
3.2.3.1. Use of ISO 3166 country codes
Multiple data elements within the ICSR identify countries, either in relation to the drug, the event, the
sender or the reporter.E2B (R3) references ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, in the data elements which capture
country codes.
3.2.3.2. Use of message encoding
ICH M2 recommends to use UTF-8 for XML message encoding in all messages developed based on ICH
electronic guidelines.

3.3. ICH E2B(R3) specifications for the transmission of ICSRs
The E2B(R3) specification has a detailed breakdown of each data element in the ICH ICSR, as well as
notes on transmission and user guidance information.

3.3.1. Minimum information
The minimum information for valid safety report should include at least:


one identifiable patient - any one of several data elements is considered sufficient to define an
identifiable patient (e.g. initials, age, sex);



one identifiable reporter - any one of several data elements is considered sufficient to define an
identifiable reporter (e.g. initials, address, qualifications);



one adverse event/reaction (or outcome); and



one suspect or interacting drug.

Note: Additional validation rules for the required ‘minimal information’ might exist at the regional level.
Any one of several data elements is sufficient to define an identifiable patient (e.g. initials,
age, and sex) or an identifiable reporter (e.g. initials, address, and qualification). The
guideline ICH E2D Section 5.1
(http://www.ich.org/products/guidelines/efficacy/article/efficacy-guidelines.html) provides
further guidance on this topic. It is also recognised that the patient and the reporter can be
the same individual and still fulfil the minimum reporting criteria. Due to data privacy
legislation in some countries, the patient’s initials and other patient identifiers might not be
exchanged between countries. However, at least one of the data elements in the section
D.1 must be populated and user guidance for this data element is provided.

ICH guideline E2B (R3) on electronic transmission of individual case safety reports
(ICSRs) - data elements and message specification - implementation guide
EMA/CHMP/ICH/287/1995

Page 22/137

3.3.2. Definition of data elements within a message
The guidance for transmitting ICSR information includes provisions for transmitting all relevant data
useful to assess an individual adverse event/reaction report. The message standard from which this
guidance is derived is fully capable of conveying a comprehensive ICSR. However, it is noted that each
and every data element will not be available for each and every transmission.
In fact, for most ICSRs, a number of data elements will be unknown, and therefore, not transmitted in
the report. Since ICSR information will be transmitted electronically, it is unnecessary to assign values
to unknown, optional data elements. However, in certain cases it is important to understand if a data
element is null because it is not applicable or because it is unknown or because it is ‘protected’ by
privacy legislation. In those cases, provisions for expressing a null value are included in the message
for a data element to indicate the absence of data and reason.
Furthermore, in addition to the minimum information required for an ICSR report (See Section 3.3.1)
certain specific administrative information should be provided to properly process the report:
Sender’s (case) Safety Report Unique Identifier (C.1.1);


Type of Report (C.1.3);



Date of Most Recent Information for This Report (C.1.5);



Dose This Case Fulfil the Local Criteria for an Expedited Report? (C.1.7);



Worldwide Unique Case Identification (C.1.8);



Reporter’s Country Code (C.2.r.3);



Sender’s Organisation (C.3.2); and



When type of report=‘Report from study’, Study Type Where Reaction(s) / Event(s)Were Observed
(C.5.4).

3.3.3. General principles
While complete information is desirable, a minimum set of information is always required for an ICSR
to be valid. This applies to all types of ICSRs including initial case reports, follow-up information, and
cases to be amended or nullified.
All the information available should be reported in fully structured format using the relevant E2B(R3)
data elements and applicable standard terminologies. Those terminologies include; ISO (country codes,
gender codes and language codes), MedDRA (e.g. medical history, indication, and reaction / event),
UCUM (units of measurement), and ICH M5 (IDMP, see Section 3.2.1.1 for details). Please refer to
each standard for further information.
Although the exchange of other unstructured data (e.g. published articles, full clinical records, X-Ray
images, etc.) is outside the scope of this IG, the technical solution to transmit attachments is provided
in Section 3.5.

3.3.4. Retransmission of cases
Based on regional reporting obligations and business arrangements in pharmacovigilance, an ICSR
may be re-transmitted several times between different senders and receivers. During this retransmission process, medical information ‘received’ on the case should not be omitted or changed
during the retransmission when no new information on the case is available to the re-transmitting
sender.
ICH guideline E2B (R3) on electronic transmission of individual case safety reports
(ICSRs) - data elements and message specification - implementation guide
EMA/CHMP/ICH/287/1995

Page 23/137

There are certain exceptions and the following data elements might be updated:


Sender’s (case) Safety Report Unique Identifier (C.1.1);



Date of Creation(C.1.2);



Date Report Was First Received from Source (C.1.4);



Date of Most Recent Information for This Report (C.1.5);



Are Additional Documents Available? (C.1.6.1);



Does This Case Fulfil the Local Criteria for an Expedited Report? (C.1.7);



Information on Sender of Case Safety Report (C.3);



Seriousness Criteria at Event Level (E.i.3.2);



More Information Available (F.r.7);



Assessment of Relatedness of Drug to Reaction(s)/ Event(s) (repeat as necessary) (G.k.9.i.2.r);



Sender's Diagnosis (repeat as necessary) (H.3.r);



Sender's Comments (H.4); and



English translation of the free text data elements in the ICSRs.



In addition to these data elements, it is also possible to update MedDRA coded data elements with
the most recent version of MedDRA.

There could be situations in which more than one ICSR shares the same ‘Worldwide Unique Case
Identification Number’ (C.1.8.1), or due to sequential updates to information in the same case, more
than one ICSR could share the same ‘Date of Most Recent Information’ (C.1.5).For these situations,
‘Date of Creation’ (C.1.2) should be used to identify the most recent version of the case.

3.3.5. Notes on format of data elements
E2B (R3) data elements have a hierarchical tree structure. It consists of two major sections A and B,
where A contains administrative and identification information, and B contains information on the case.
The subsidiary sections are categorised by the nature of the data, and are:




Section A


C.1 - Identification of the Case Safety Report;



C.2- Primary Source(s) of Information;



C.3 - Information on Sender of Case Safety Report;



C.4 - Literature Reference(s);



C.5 - Study Identification.

Section B


D - Patient Characteristics;



E - Reaction(s)/ Event(s);



F - Results of Tests and Procedures Relevant to the Investigation of the Patient;

EMA/CHMP/ICH/287/1995

Page 24/137



G - Drug(s) Information; and



H - Narrative Case Summary and Further Information.

In addition to the letters ‘i’ and ‘k’ indicating iterations of the event (E.i) or the drug (G.k), the letter ‘r’
is used to indicate that the data element or the section is repeatable.
It is recognised that the numbering scheme for the data elements in this IG is
different than the one used in the E2B (R2).

3.3.6. General rules for data entry


Date / Time Format
HL7 uses a single format to represent dates and times: CCYYMMDDHHMMSS.UUUU[+|-ZZzz].
Complete date time information down to seconds can be reported using this format. This date
format makes it possible to provide data to the appropriate degree of precision.
‘Future dates’ cannot be transmitted in an ICH ICSR message.When transmissions occur across
different time zones, senders and receivers should configure their systems (e.g. attach the ZZzz
offset to Coordinated Universal Time) to prevent dates and times to be interpreted as ‘future
dates’.
Please refer to Appendix II in this IG for more detail.
For E2B(R3), minimum level of date precision for each date data element is specified in Section
3.4.
A single format (CCYYMMDDHHMMSS.UUUU[+|-ZZzz]) is used to represent dates
and times throughout this IG. This format allows for varying degrees of precision
to be exchanged for date and time information, from only the year, down to the
second.
The minimum level of precision for the date data elements is specified in Section
3.4, however, as much information as available (e.g. known) should be provided.



All free text data elements (with the exception of the ‘Reaction/Event as Reported by the Primary
Source in Native Language’ (E.i.1.1a)and the ‘Case Summary and Reporter’s Comments in Native
Language’(H.5.r)) are to be provided in English for international transmission. However, the
message control act wrapper supports language codes for regional message exchanges. Please
refer to regional implementation guides.



Metric units should be used exclusively.



For ICSR reporting, MedDRA is commonly used in the EU, US, and Japan as well as other
countries/regions that are ICH Observers (e.g. Canada and Switzerland).The MedDRA LLT most
closely corresponding to the event/reaction as reported by the primary source is recommended for
all data elements required for MedDRA coding. When there is not an exact match to a MedDRA LLT,
the LLT most closely corresponding to the adverse drug event/reaction as reported by the primary
source should be given. For advice on describing syndromes, please refer to the latest edition of
the ICH document ‘MedDRA Term Selection: Points to Consider’. Advice current at the time of this
writing is provided in sections on ‘Diagnosis and sign/symptom’ and ‘Definitive and Provisional
Diagnoses with or without Signs and Symptoms’.



In certain instances, provisions have been made for transmission of free text items, including a full
text case summary narrative. Text data elements are intended to provide additional information
that cannot be provided in structured format using reference standard terminology.

ICH guideline E2B (R3) on electronic transmission of individual case safety reports
(ICSRs) - data elements and message specification - implementation guide
EMA/CHMP/ICH/287/1995

Page 25/137



Only one version of MedDRA can be used to code the relevant data elements within a single ICSR.
Therefore, the same MedDRA version should be identified each time a MedDRA term is populated.
However, multiple ICSRs are submitted in a single batch, different ICSRs can refer to different
MedDRA version.
For all data elements that reflect a MedDRA coded value, the same MedDRA
version should be used for all data elements in a single ICSR. However, when
multiple ICSRs are submitted in a single batch, different ICSRs can refer to
different MedDRA version.

It should be noted that:
The data type for each element will be described as follows:


A=Alpha: This data type is primarily used within the ICSR for certain data elements that
require controlled vocabulary, such as the ‘Reporter’s Country Code’(C.2.r.3) - 2A, to
accommodate the ISO3166 code. The string data elements that require the Alpha data type
can contain only upper and lower case alphabetic characters, e.g. ‘JP’. Numbers and special
characters, such as “.,^’ are not allowed;



AN=AlphaNumeric: String data element that can contain alphabetic, numerical and special
characters. Example: ‘AB-19.990115‘”^’.Regarding all aspects of XML, the W3C standards
should be followed as published at http://www.w3.org/.For example, when the XML special
characters >, < and & occur in text, data elements they should always be replaced by &gt; &lt;
and &amp; respectively; or



N=numeric: String data element that contains only the characters ‘0-9.E+-’ used to represent
an integer or floating point numbers, including scientific notation. Example: ‘1.23E-1’ or
‘34192’ or ‘32.12’.Commas are not permitted.



Date: See Appendix II (A)



Boolean: Boolean values are represented by:
‘false’ which can also equate to ‘no’;
‘true ’which can also equate to ‘yes’*;
‘nullflavor’ which can have different meanings in different scenarios. HL7 refers to these as
‘null flavors’. (See below)
For the purposes of this IG, there is one exception to this rule for the
‘Investigational Product Blinded’(G.k.2.5) where ‘true’= ‘blinded’.



All mandatory data elements must always be part of the ICSR message, however optional
elements do not have to be transmitted. A blank optional element may not appear in the XML code.
A blank mandatory element needs to appear in the XML code for the message to be valid.


Some elements might need to be transmitted as part of a valid ICSR yet might need to be
empty of content for specific reasons. In HL7 messaging it is possible to transmit an empty
element and to code the element to explain the reason for the lack of data. This allows for the
creation of valid messages containing mandatory elements without transmitting content. This
reason for a blank element is referred to as the ‘flavor’ of the null value.

(ICSRs) - data elements and message specification - implementation guide
EMA/CHMP/ICH/287/1995

Page 26/137



nullFlavors: ICH ICSR uses the following codes from the HL7 Messaging Standard to categorise
exceptions. For further information, please see the standard ISO / HL7 27953-2. Not all
nullFlavors are valid for all data types (e.g. PINF and NINF for non-numeric data elements).

Code

Name

Definition

NI

No

No information whatsoever can be inferred from this exceptional value.

Information

This is the most general exceptional value. It is also the default exceptional
value.

MSK

Masked

There is information on this item available but it has not been provided by
the sender due to security, privacy or other reasons. There could be an
alternate mechanism for gaining access to this information. Note: using
this nullFlavor can provide information considered to be a breach of
confidentiality, even though no detail data is provided. Its primary purpose
is for those circumstances where it is necessary to inform the receiver that
the information does exist without providing any detail.

UNK

Unknown

A proper value is applicable, but not known.

NA

Not Applicable

No proper value is applicable in this context (e.g. last menstrual period for
a male).

ASKU

Asked But

Information was sought but not found (e.g. patient was asked but didn't

Unknown

NASK

Not Asked

This information has not been sought (e.g. patient was not asked)

NINF

Negative

Negative infinity of numbers.

3.3.7. Details of ICH E2B(R3) data elements
All of the E2B(R3) data elements and message specifications are described in tables in Section 3.4. The
E2B(R3) data element table contains:


the data element number;


For the purpose of this IG, data elements for the Acknowledgement message will be preceded
by the letters ACK, for example:
data element N.1.2 refers to the ‘Batch Number’ as detailed in Section 3.4; and
ACK.M.1 refers to the ‘Acknowledgement Batch Number’ in the Acknowledgement transaction.



the data element name;



a definition appears under ‘User Guidance’ to provide information on how to populate correctly
each E2B (R3) data element;



‘Conformance’ indicates if a value for the data element is mandatory / required or optional. Some
data elements are required for ‘technical’ reasons (e.g. to parse the message correctly) and will
generate an error when omitted. A list of required elements is provided in Appendix I (G) the
Technical Information.



‘Data Type’ and data element length－each data element will use a number to denote the width of
a data element followed by A for alpha, N for numeric, or AN for alphanumeric. For data elements
referencing a code set (e.g. not a free text data element), the organisation that maintains the
terminology should be consulted to obtain the most current specifications;



an Object Identifier (‘OID’) －identifies if a specific code list or namespace applies to the data
element. The OIDs provided in this IG should be used in XML messages for the ICH ICSR;



‘Value Allowed’ indicates possible values for the data element; and



‘Business Rule(s)’provide additional details on validation rules for some data elements.

The messaging specifications in this IG are the agreed, harmonised rules used by the ICH parties.
These are the validation conditions applied to ‘inbound’ ICH ICSR XML messages (e.g. applied by
ICH guideline E2B (R3) on electronic transmission of individual case safety reports
(ICSRs) - data elements and message specification - implementation guide
EMA/CHMP/ICH/287/1995

Page 28/137

‘receivers’).Therefore, this IG should be used to verify the accuracy and compliance of data entry when
preparing an ‘outbound’ ICH ICSR XML message.
It is recognised that the information in ‘Value Allowed’ printed in this document for some code lists
may become outdated or incomplete. This information will be maintained outside this IG. For a list of
the most recent codes, please see the code lists in Appendix I (F).
The specifications in the ICH E2B(R3) data element in Section 3.4 are the
harmonised data validation rules in ICH. These data elements should be
consulted to verify the accuracy and compliance of data entry when preparing
outbound ICH ICSR XML messages.

For codes in ‘Value Allowed’, please see the most recent code lists in Appendix I

C.1.1 Sender’s (case) safety report unique identifier
User Guidance

This data element contains an identifier for the ICSR that is unique. The value
should be a concatenation of3 segments separated by a dash/hyphen: ‘country
code-company or regulator name-report number’. Country code is the 2-letter
ISO 3166 part 1 code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) corresponding to the country of the
primary source of the report (C.2.r.3); in exceptional circumstances where the
country of primary source is unknown, the country where the reaction occurred
(E.i.9) should be used to indicate the country code. The company or regulator
name is an internationally unique abbreviation or code for the sender’s
organisation; the use of a ‘-‘ (dash/hyphen) should be avoided in this segment.
The report number is the organisation’s international case number.
For example, a report transmitted from a company to a regulatory authority
concerning a case from France would populate C.1.1 with ‘FR-companyname12345’ where 12345 is that company’s unique case report number.
When the same sender retransmits the same case (e.g. to transmit follow-up
information), C.1.1 usually remains constant. Exceptions are:
In the case of an organisational change, (e.g. a merger between companies or a
name change), follow-up reports can be identified in C.1.1 by the identifier of
the newly named organisation.
In the case of changes of country code for primary source for regulatory
purposes (C.2.r.3) or the country where the reaction occurred (E.i.9), C.1.1 can
be changed.
However, the ‘Worldwide Unique Case Identification Number’ (C.1.8.1) used in
any previous transmissions of the case should always remain the same (See the
user guidance for C.1.8).
Other retransmitters should replace this value with their own unique identifier.

Business Rule(s)
A two character country code will be used in all instances for the country
component of the Unique Identifier. The country code EU exists in the ISO 3166
country code list as an exceptional reservation code to support any application
that needs to represent the name European Union. In this case, ‘EU’ will be
accepted as the country code.
The format of C.1.1 ensures a unique report identifier for the sender of
particular ICSR.
The use of a ‘-’ (dash/hyphen) should be avoided in the ‘company or regulator
name’.
Both the ‘Sender's (case) Safety Report Unique Identifier’ (C.1.1) and the
‘Worldwide Unique Case Identification Number’ (C.1.8.1) data elements are
mapped to the repeatable XML attribute<id> in the ‘investigationEvent’ entity in

User Guidance

This data element has the function of a timestamp and represents the

C.1.3 Type of report
User Guidance

This data element captures the type of report independently of its source; a
separate element for the designation of the source is covered in item C.4 and is
not duplicated in this section.
For example, if a case in the literature arises from spontaneous observations,
‘type of report’ should be Spontaneous report.
If a case in the literature arises from a study, ‘type of report’ should be Report
from study and the differentiation between types of studies (e.g. clinical trials or
others) should be given in Section C.5.4 (See the user guidance for C.5.4).
If it is unclear from the literature report whether or not the case(s) cited are
spontaneous observations or whether they arise from a study, then this item
should be Other.
The Not available to sender option allows for the transmission of information by
a secondary sender (e.g. regulatory authority) where the initial sender did not
specify the type of report; it differs from Other, which indicates that the sender
knows the type of report but cannot fit it into the categories provided.

When a sender has not previously received the ICSR in an electronic format (e.g. the information was
taken from a paper CIOMS, journal article, etc.) and thus creates the ‘initial’ electronic ICSR, the
identifiers (content and format) in C.1.1 and C.1.8.1 are identical.
Retransmitters should use their own sender’s (case) safety report unique identifier in data element
C.1.1, but not change the values in data elements C.1.8.1 and C.1.8.2.
When a regulator is the initial sender, C.1.8.2 should be flagged as 1=Regulator.
When an entity other than a regulator is the initial sender, C.1.8.2 should be flagged as 2=Other.

being evaluated together with this ICSR. This includes, but is not limited to, a
mother/parent-child pair where both had events/reactions, siblings with
common exposure, several reports involving the same patient, an ICSR
previously sent via paper without a conformant E2B Worldwide Unique Case
Identification Number, or several similar reports from same reporter (cluster).
The reason for the linkage between ICSRs should be provided in H.4.
For example, if a sender wishes to reference (link) an ICSR A to ICSR B, then
the sender populates the data element C.1.10.r in both reports:

C.1.11 Report nullification / amendment
C.1.11.1 Report nullification / amendment
User Guidance

This data element should be used to indicate that a previously transmitted ICSR
is either considered completely void (nullified) (for example when the whole
case was found to be erroneous), or amended (for example when, after an
internal review or according to an expert opinion, some items have been
corrected, such as adverse event/reaction terms, seriousness, seriousness
criteria or causality assessment). In case of amendment it is important to use
the same ‘Sender’s (case) Safety Report Unique Identifier’ (C1.1) and
‘Worldwide Unique Case Identification’ (C.1.8) previously submitted (See
exceptions in C.1.1).If it becomes necessary to submit a report that has been
previously nullified, a new ‘Sender’s (case) Safety Report Unique Identifier’
(C.1.1) and ‘Worldwide Unique Identifier’ (C.1.8.1) should be assigned. The date
originally reported in C.1.5 should not be changed in an amended or nullified
report if no new information on the case has been received from a primary
source.

The primary source of the information is the person who provides the facts about the ICSR. In case of
multiple sources, the ‘Primary Source for Regulatory Purposes’ (C.2.r.5) is the person who first
reported the facts to the sender. The primary source should be distinguished from senders and
retransmitters; the latter is captured in Section C.3.

The identification of the reporter (primary source) could be prohibited by certain
national or regional confidentiality requirements. The information should be
provided when it is in conformance with confidentiality requirements.
However, at least one subsection for each Primary Source should be completed to
ensure that it is an identifiable reporter.
If only the name of the reporter is known and confidentiality requirements
prohibit transmission of the reporter’s full name or initials, the data elements
C.2.r.1.2, C.2.r.1.3, and/or C.2.r.1.4 can be masked and ‘populated’ with a
nullFlavor as appropriate, in compliance with confidentiality requirements or
reporter request. Please see Section 3.3.6 for further guidance on the use of
nullFlavor to describe missing or non-transmitted information.

Each ICSR shall have one primary reporter (primary source) identified in
conformance with regional confidentiality requirements.
Depending on the local legal requirements regarding confidentiality, it might be
necessary to mask some of the elements used to identify the reporter in the

If the elements that are being used to identify the reporter are known to the
sender but cannot be transmitted due to data privacy requirements, then those
data elements should be left blank with nullFlavor = MSK.

D Patient characteristics
This section describes the singular subject who experienced one or several adverse events/reactions.
As many patient characteristics as available (e.g. known) should be provided. However, at least one
data element in Section D must be populated with a meaningful value or masked to fulfil the criteria
‘one identifiable patient’ (See Section 3.3.1).
At least one of the data elements in Section D must be populated with a
meaningful value or masked to fulfil the criteria ‘one identifiable patient’.
In cases where a foetus or breast-feeding infant is exposed to one or several drugs through the parent
and experienced one or several adverse events/reactions, information on both the parent and the
child/foetus should be provided. Reports of these cases are referred to as parent-child/foetus reports.
The following general principles should be used for filing these reports.


If there has been no event/reaction affecting the child/foetus, the parent-child/foetus report does
not apply; e.g. the data elements in Section D apply only to the parent (mother or father) who
experienced the adverse reaction/event.
Example: Mother suffers from pre-eclampsia and the child has no adverse reaction. Only one
ICSR should be completed for the mother, with the adverse event/reaction of pre-eclampsia.
No events/reactions are reported for the child, therefore a linked ICSR for the child is not
applicable.



For those cases describing miscarriage, stillbirth or early spontaneous abortion, only a mother
report is applicable, e.g. the data elements in Section D apply to the mother. However, if suspect
drug(s) were taken by the father, this information should be indicated in the data element G.k.10.r.



If both the parent and the child/foetus sustain adverse event(s)/reaction(s), two separate reports,
e.g. one for the parent (mother or father) and one for the child/foetus, should be provided and
should be linked by using the data element C.1.10.r in each report.
Example: Mother suffers from pre-eclampsia and, at parturition, the baby had a low birth
weight and club foot. Two linked ICSRs should be submitted: The mother’s report should have
the adverse event/reaction of pre-eclampsia; the report for the baby should have
event/reaction terms for low birth weight and club foot. The term pre-eclampsia would only
apply to the mother’s case. The data element C.1.10.r should be completed for both cases (e.g.
the mother’s and baby’s).



If only the child/foetus has an adverse event/reaction (other than early spontaneous
abortion/foetal demise) the information provided in this section applies only to the child/foetus,
and characteristics concerning the parent (mother or father) who was the source of exposure to
the suspect drug should be provided in Section D.10.
Example: A report of foetal distress, where the mother delivered via a Caesarean section.
There will be one ICSR for the baby, with the adverse event/reaction of foetal distress. The
Caesarean section should not be considered an adverse event/reaction for the mother. The
mother’s characteristics, should be captured in Section D with the Caesarean section as
relevant medical history (D.10.7).



If both parents are the suspect source of exposure to the suspect drug(s) then the case should

be recorded in the data element ‘Comments’ (D.7.1.r.5). If precise dates are not known and a text
description is pertinent to understanding the medical history, or if concise additional information is
helpful in showing the relevance of the past medical history, such information can be included in the
‘Comments’ (D.7.1.r.5). In order to identify relevant medical information of the family (e.g. hereditary
diseases), the data element ‘Family History’ (D.7.1.r.6) should be set to ‘true’ (Yes) for the appropriate
medical history of the patient.
If there is no relevant medical history and no concurrent conditions for inclusion in D.7.1, then D.7.2 is
required. If the reason is that the relevant medical history is not documented at the time of the report
then the value for D.7.2 is ‘Unknown’. This should not be confused with ‘None’. In the first case the
NullFlavor is used with the value ‘UNK’ and in the second case the text ‘None’ will be transmitted.
The designation of ‘r’ in this section indicates that each item is repeatable and that it corresponds to
the same ‘r’ in all subsections. A separate block (r) should be used for each relevant medical history
term. For example, if two conditions are reported, the first condition would be described in items

therapies that cannot be structured in Section G, then the data element D.7.3 is
set to true and details are provided in the narrative Section H.1.

D.8.r Relevant past drug history (repeat as necessary)
This section concerns relevant drugs previously administered and which have been stopped before the
Adverse Event onset. It does not concern drugs taken concomitantly or drugs which might have
potentially been involved in the current reaction(s)/event(s). Medical judgment should be exercised in
completing this section. Medications that have been stopped might be considered suspect based on the
elimination half-life of the drug and the known pharmacodynamic effects of the drug in a particular
patient (for example, a patient with known renal or liver impairment).Information concerning
concomitant and other suspect drugs should be included in Section G. The information provided here
can also include previous experience with similar drugs.
To standardise this information, the ICH M5 IG also should be used. Based on the medicinal product
name as reported by the primary source, the most specific identifier, being either the Medicinal Product
ICH guideline E2B (R3) on electronic transmission of individual case safety reports
(ICSRs) - data elements and message specification - implementation guide
EMA/CHMP/ICH/287/1995

Page 68/137

Identifier (MPID) or the Pharmaceutical Product Identifier (PhPID), should be provided. If a MPID or a
PhPID for the reported medicinal product is not available, these data elements should be left blank.
A MedDRA LLT numeric code should be used for the ‘Indication’ (D.8.r.6b) and the ‘Reaction’
(D.8.r.7b).In the event of previous exposure to drug(s) or vaccine(s) without reaction, the MedDRA
code ‘No adverse effect’ should be used in the Reaction column. Imprecise dates can be used for both
start and end dates.
The designation of ‘r’ in this section indicates that each item is repeatable and that it corresponds to
the same ‘r’ in all subsections. A separate block (r) should be used for each relevant drug term. For
example, if two drugs are reported, the first drug would be described in items D.8.1.1 through D.8.1.7
and the other drug would be described in items D.8.2.1 through D.8.2.7.
Overall, a conservative approach should be taken and if there is any doubt, the product should be
considered a suspect drug. If there are critical or controversial issues to be discussed in regard to this
judgment they can be briefly mentioned in a narrative in Section H.
As a general principle all drugs that were completed / discontinued before the
start of the treatment with the suspect(ed) drug(s) should be included in the
‘Relevant Past Drug History’ section (D.8). Any drug(s) that are not suspected of
causing the event or reaction and that are administered to the patient at the time
of the reaction should be listed as concomitant medication in Section G.
A history of allergy to a specific drug is preferably reported in Section D.8
‘Relevant Past Drug History’, using the suspect drug name and MedDRA terms in
the indication and reaction data elements. These data elements are often
searchable in most databases and thus this is the preferred option.
When a non-specific allergy is reported (e.g. ‘sulfa’ allergy is reported, but
unknown if to a sulphonamide antibiotic or to a sulfa-containing diuretic), this
information could be reported in Section D.7.1 ‘Structured information on
relevant medical history’ by using the LLT ‘Drug hypersensitivity’ (or a more
descriptive LLT) under ‘Disease / surgical procedure / etc.’, and the name of the
drug under ‘comments’.

For technical reason, each reaction / event should be assigned an internal ID so
that G.k.9.i.1 can refer to the reaction / event from the drug / event matrix.
A separate block (i) should be used for each reaction/event term. For example, if
two reactions are observed, the first reaction would be described in items E.1.1
through E.1.9, and the other reaction would be described in items E.2.1 through

highlighted term. This data element should be populated only if the medical
concept conveyed in E.i.1 is consistent with the reason why the reporter
contacted the sender. For example, this data element can be used to indicate
the specific diagnosis that was identified by the reporter. Suppose the reporter
specifies flu-like syndrome comprising of fever, chills, sneezing, myalgia and
headache, then flu-like syndrome is the highlighted term. If only one event is
cited in a case report, this one is by implication considered highlighted by the
reporter.
It is assumed that the event seriousness is provided by the reporter; otherwise,
it is assessed by the sender.

Business Rule(s)
See E.i.3.2 for the ‘seriousness’ assessment of the highlighted term.

E.i.3.2 Seriousness criteria at event level
The seriousness criteria of the reaction/event should be based on the definitions provided in the ICH
E2A and E2D guidelines. More than one seriousness criteria can be chosen. If the event is not serious,
all of these data elements should be left blank. It is assumed that the event seriousness is provided by
the reporter; otherwise, it is assessed by the sender.
In cases of foetal demise such as miscarriage, (where the ICSR should be prepared only for the parent),
the seriousness criterion is ‘Other medically important condition’. Furthermore, depending if the parent
experienced complications, the seriousness criterion could also include ‘life-threatening’ and/or
‘hospitalisation’.

This data element captures the latest outcome of the reaction / event at the

In case of irreversible congenital anomalies, the choice not recovered/not
resolved/ongoing should be used. For other irreversible medical conditions,
recovered/resolved with sequelae should be used.
Fatal should be used when death is possibly related to the reaction/event.
Considering the difficulty of deciding between ‘reaction/event caused death’ and
‘reaction/event contributed significantly to death’, both concepts are grouped in
a single category. Where the death is unrelated to the reaction/event, according
to both the reporter and the sender, ‘fatal’ should NOT be selected here;
nevertheless, death should be reported under Section D.9.

G.K Drug(s) information (repeat as necessary)
This section covers both suspect and concomitant medications (including biologics) including drugs
suspected to have a type of interaction (e.g. drug, food, tobacco, etc).A minimum of one suspect
medication needs to be provided for each valid ICSR. Medications used to treat the reaction/event
should not be included here.
For each drug, the ‘Characterisation of the Drug Role’ (G.k.1) is the one reported or implied by the
primary reporter (e.g. the original source of the information).Suspect medications are those health
products taken by the patient and suspected by the reporter to have contributed to the adverse
reaction described in Section E. The suspect medication might have been stopped before the reaction
is observed, for example, a single dose of an antibiotic could be suspected to cause diarrhoea one
week later. However, concomitant medications are only those health products taken by the patient at
the time the reaction is observed; other relevant medication history should be recorded in Section D.8.
As for the designation ‘i’ in Section E above, the designation of ‘k’ in this section indicates that each
item is repeatable and that it corresponds to the same ‘k’ in all subsections. A separate block (k)
should be used for each health product. Within a block (k), subsections can also repeat using the
designation ‘r’, and within a subsection (r), further sub-subsections can repeat using the designation
‘i’.
The designation of ‘k’ in this section indicates that each item is repeatable and
that it corresponds to the same ‘k’ in all subsections. A separate block (k) should
be used for each drug. Drugs used to treat the reaction/event should not be
included here.

G.k.1 Characterisation of drug role
User Guidance

This data element contains the characterisation of the drug role as provided by
the primary reporter or, if this information is missing, by the sender. All
spontaneous reports should have at least one suspect drug (See Section 3.3.1).
If the reporter indicates a suspected interaction with other drug(s), ‘interacting’
should be selected for all suspected interacting drug(s). If an interaction is
suspected with food or other non-drug compounds, ‘interacting’ should be
selected for the suspect drug. For evaluation purposes, all interacting drugs are
considered to be suspect drugs. The type of interaction (e.g. drug interaction,
food interaction, alcohol interaction, etc.), should be captured with the
appropriate MedDRA LLT(s) in Section E.i Reaction(s) / Event(s) along with any
event(s) resulting from the suspected interaction.
‘Drug not administered’ can be used in two circumstances:
In clinical trial: if the adverse event occurred after the informed consent was
signed but prior to the administration of the study drug (e.g. during the
screening period or the washout procedure), the adverse event should in
general be reported as per the trial procedure. In that case, only sections G.k.1,
G.k.2 and G.k.8 are to be filled out for that Section G. The information on the
suspect cause of the event should be provided in the narrative H.1. In addition,
comments can be provided by the reporter in H.2 and by the sender in the H.4.
Medication error: if the patient did not receive the actual prescribed drug but
another one, repeatable Sections G should be completed with the information
about the prescribed drug (including the fact that it was not administered), as
well as the information on the dispensed drug as the ‘suspect’ drug. The
medication error should be captured with the appropriate MedDRA LLT code in

Business Rule(s)
Each ICSR must contain at least one ‘Suspect’, ‘Interacting’ or ‘Drug Not
Administered’.

Suspect medications are those health products taken by the patient and
suspected by the reporter to have contributed to the adverse reaction described
in Section E. Concomitant medications are only those health products taken by
the patient at the time the reaction is observed; other relevant medication
history should be recorded in Section D.8.

G.k.2 Drug identification
Medicinal product names or active ingredient names should be provided in G.k.2.2 as they were
reported by the primary source. To standardise the identification of medicinal products, the ICH M5 IG
should be used. When available, the most precise structured information should be provided when
identifying medicinal products and redundant information does not have to be repeated. For example,
if a MPID is provided in G.k.2.1.1, there is no need to provide a PhPID in G.k.2.1.2.Likewise, if a PhPID
is provided, there is no need to provide information for Substance.

In case of investigational drugs, provide as much information as known in G.k.2.2
and G.k.2.3.r.1 even if only an abstract code might be known.
If more than one substance name is specified for a drug product, each of them
should be included in this section by repeating the item G.k.2.3 as necessary.
The product name used by the reporter should always be provided.

G.k.4.r Dosage and relevant information (repeat as necessary)
Data elements G.k.4.r.1 through G.k.4.r.3 should be used to provide dosage information. For example,
5mg (in one dose) every other day, subsections G.k.4.r.1 through G.k.4.r.3 would be 5, mg, 2, day,
respectively. In the same way, 50mg daily would be 50, mg, 1, day, respectively.
For multiple dosages within a given interval, a fraction of that interval is given. For example, 5mg four
times in one day (QID), subsections G.k.4.r.1 through G.k.4.r.3 would be 5, mg, 0.25, day,
respectively.
For fixed dose combination drugs dose unit (G.k.4.r.1b) should be provided as arbitrary unit {DF}
instead of mg.
In the case of a parent-child/foetus report, the dosage section applies to the known parental dose. For
example, if the mother took the drug(s) suspected of causing adverse reaction(s) in a nursing infant,
then the dosage information (G.k.4.r.1 to G.k.4.r.11.2) relates to how the mother took the
medication(s). If the mother is the source of the suspect drug(s) then the dosage information reflects
how the mother ingested or was administered the drug(s). If a father is the source of the suspect
drug(s) then the additional information on drug (G.k.10) is provided. The case narrative (H.1) should
describe the entire case, including the father’s information.
For a dosage regimen that involves more than one dosage form, and where provision of structured
dosage information is not possible, the information should be provided as text in SectionG.k.4.r.8.

G.k.9.i Drug-reaction(s) / event(s) matrix (repeat as necessary)
This section provides the means to transmit the degree of suspected relatedness of the drug (k) with a
suspect role to each reaction(s)/event(s) (i) in Section E. The repeating items (r) are used to provide
the assessment of relatedness by different sources or methods of assessment. For the purpose of
reporting, there is an implied suspicion of causality for spontaneous reports. It is recognised that
information concerning the relatedness, especially for spontaneous reports, is often subjective and
might not be available.
The following example illustrates the functionality contained in this section.


Assume the patient has had three adverse events: Event1, Event2, and Event3



The reporter provided assessment of causality for events Event1 and Event2, but not for Event3.
The reporter’s assessment of causality is based on overall impression, which the sender codes as
‘global introspection’.



The sender provided two methods of causality assessment, one with an algorithm (coded
algorithm) and the other a Bayesian analysis (coded Bardi).



From the above there are 2 sets of data for the reporter (2_events X 1_method of assessment)
and 6 sets for the sender (3_events X 2_methods of assessment) for a total 8 sets of data.

The appropriate item with the ‘relatedness’ information is G.k.9.i.2.r.x (where x equals the 3 sub data
elements 1-3). Please note the sub data elements 1-3 are repeatable. For subsection G.k.9.i.1, a
technical reference to the reaction / event in E.i should be used. Subsections G.k.9.i.2.r.1, G.k.9.i.2.r.2
and G.k.9.i.2.r.3 do not call for a standardised methodology or vocabulary.

If an event is spontaneously reported to a company about a patient who took that
company's drug, and the relationship is unstated, it implies a suspected causal relationship
to the drug. However, data elements G.k.9.i.1 through G.k.9.i.2.r.3 should be left blank
unless otherwise required by local regulation.
The company's causality assessment can be captured in data elements G.k.9.i.1 through
G.k.9.i.2.r.3. Additionally, the Sender's Comments in Section H.4 can be used to further
elaborate sender’s position or assessment.
Local regulatory requirements regarding expedited and periodic reporting determine

3.5. Document attachments
In order to provide supplemental information, the sender of an ICSR might need to attach documents
to the ICSR. Attachments can be presented in-line within the ICSR message itself; however, a
reference to a document URL is not permitted. In-line data is transmitted as part of the encapsulated
data value in the ICSR message.

3.5.1. User guidance
When the sender holds a clinical document other than a literature article provided from a primary
source (e.g. autopsy reports, ECG strips, chest X-ray, or photographs, etc), then C.1.6.1 should be
‘true’ and a description of that document is required in C.1.6.1.r.1.Furthermore, an electronic version
of that document can be attached to the ICSR in C.1.6.1.r.2.
When a literature article is sent as an attachment, the literature citation in Vancouver style is captured
in C.4.r.1 and the electronic version of the document (e.g. journal article) is attached to the ICSR in
C.4.r.2, rather than in C.1.6.1.r.2. (Please refer to Section 3.4 for detailed specifications for each data
element.)
Within one ICSR, multiple document titles (C.1.6.1.r) and literature titles (C.4.r.1) can be provided, as
well as the associated materials.
Although several file formats of documents (e.g. PDF, jpeg, tiff, and DICOM) are technically
permissible as attachments, each region will determine the file types and the file size that can be
processed.
Because documents might not be available at the time of ICSR reporting, attachments can be
transmitted separately from the ICSR transmission. When the sender transmits an attachment later,
the original ICSR along with all the same medical information captured in E2B(R3) data elements is
retransmitted as an ‘amendment’ (See the guidance for C.1.11.1) If the data elements in E2B(R3)
have changed, then the ICSR with attachment is transmitted as a follow-up.

3.5.2. Technical specification
It is always required that ‘attached’ documents to an ICH ICSR be provided in-line; therefore,
providing a hyperlink to the document source stored separately is not acceptable.

ICH guideline E2B (R3) on electronic transmission of individual case safety reports
(ICSRs) - data elements and message specification - implementation guide
EMA/CHMP/ICH/287/1995

Page 116/137

Each attachment has up to 3 properties, and the appropriate value for each property should be
provided in either C.1.6.1.r.2 or C.4.r.2:
i.

Media Type: Identifies the type of the encapsulated data and identifies a method to interpret
or render the data. This property indicates the data type standardised by RFC 2046
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt), (e.g. application/PDF, image/jpeg,
application/DICOM).The default value for media Type is text/plain.

ii.

Representation: Presents the type of the encapsulated data. Use TXT for text data or B64 for
binary data encoded by Base 64.

iii.

Compression: Indicates whether the data is compressed, and what compression algorithm
was used (e.g. value DF means the deflate algorithm was used).

3.5.3. Examples of XML instances
When an ICH ICSR message has 2 documents as attachment, one is a PDF file and the other is a
compressed JPEG file, these attachments are encoded in XML instance.

4. The ICSR acknowledgement transaction
An acknowledgment transaction will be sent after receipt of every ICH ICSR from known trading
partners (information received from unauthorized or unknown trading partners is not
acknowledged).The acknowledgement message includes a standard ICH ICSR header, an
acknowledgment for the message, and a repeating details section that provides information about the
processing of the original message, e.g. successful parsing or problems that prevented
parsing/accepting the message.
It is important to note that the ICH ICSR Acknowledgement is structured as the response to a batch
message, and that it contains information both for the batch and for individual messages (reports)
within that batch.

4.1. Acknowledgement message in HL7
Within HL7 messaging, this functionality is managed using the Transmission Infrastructure.
For the purposes of this IG, it will be assumed that all transactions are batched, and that all responses
will refer to the original batch wrapper, as well as to the message. The root message types needed are
MCCI_IN200101UV and MCCI_MT200101UV; the stub is MCCI_MT000200UV.
For the purposes of this IG, it will be assumed that all transactions are batched,
and that all responses will refer to the original batch wrapper, as well as to each
message in that batch.

4.2. ICH ICSR acknowledgement message
The Acknowledgement header contains core transactional information related to the receipt of the
batch transmission. The data elements used for the ICH ICSR Acknowledgement are described
below.
Data elements beginning with ACK.M contain technical information required for Acknowledgement
message.
Data elements beginning with ACK.A contain technical information relating to batch received. This A
section provides information to identify the batch being acknowledged as well as providing summary
data on receipt and parsing. In particular, the information provided is for the entire batch rather than
for any specific ICSR message in that batch.
Data elements beginning with ACK.B contain information relating to each ICSR message within the
received batch. This B section contains information related to each ICSR message within a batch,
including any errors detected within the message.

a) Core Schemas

infrastructureRoot
User

Infrastructure Root Class locates at the top layer of HL7 Class structure and defines

Guidance

necessary properties which are applied to all elements in messages for transmission.
This schema, derived from Infrastructure Root Class, defines attributes commonly used
in complex type where attributes or child elements are defined. infrastructureRoot
schema is referenced from complex type.

datatypes-base
User

The HL7 datatypes, which are used within the definition of all model elements, are

Guidance

defined within the two schemas, datatypes-base, and datatypes. datatypes-baseschema
defines data types for both complex type (e.g. ED, CD) and simple type (e.g. ST, CS).
HL7 data types are categorised into ‘Basic data type’ and ‘Generic data type’. This
schema defines Basic data type and part of Generic data type. Basic data type is a
combination of Generic data types and such components are included in this schema.

datatypes
User

The HL7 datatypes, which are used within the definition of all model elements, are

Guidance

defined within the two schemas, datatypes-base and datatypes.datatypesdefines
‘Generic data type’ which is used by setting a parameter in definition (e.g. A Generic
data type IVL_<T> becomes IVL_<TS> or IVL_<PQ> with parameters at <T>).

Voc
User

The schema includes the vocabulary items that are defined by HL7 for use by all

Guidance

Implementers (at the ‘universal’ level).It includes the vocabulary domains that have
been defined through RIM harmonisation, and the value sets that are defined by
HL7.For the most part, these apply to HL7 structural attributes, and to data types.

Appendix II – Date / Time
ICH has elected to utilise the HL7 Standard for datatypes to specify numeric representations of date
and time. The time notation is the de facto standard in almost all countries while the date notation is
increasingly popular.HL7 Standard for datatypes notation is the commonly recommended format for
representing date and time as human-readable strings in communication protocols and file formats.
This notation has several important advantages when used in electronic files or messages as compared
to traditional date and time notations. Since it orders the units from most significant to least
significant, there are benefits with regard to flexibility, sorting, and for comparison after truncation.

Appendix II (A) Date / Time
The international standard date / time notation is CCYYMMDDhhmmsswhere
i)

CCYY is the century and year in the usual Gregorian calendar,

ii) MM is the month of the year between 01 (January) and 12 (December),
iii) DD is the day of the month between 01 and 31,
iv) hh is the number of complete hours that have passed since midnight (00-24),
v) mm is the number of complete minutes that have passed since the start of the hour (00-59),
and
vi) ss is the number of complete seconds since the start of the minute (00-59).
For example, the fourth day of February, 1995 is written as 19950204.
If only the month is of interest, then CCYYMM can be used.
Example: 199502
If only the year is of interest, then just CCYY is acceptable.
Example: 1995
The time (hhmmss) one second before midnight is written as 235959.
The precision can be reduced by omitting the seconds or both the seconds and minutes.
Example: 2359, or just 23
It is also possible to add fractions of a second after a decimal dot (.).
Example: 235959.9942 is 5.8ms before midnight.
As every day both ‘start’ and ‘end’ with midnight, the two notations 00:00 and 24:00 are available.
This means that the following two notations refer to exactly the same point in time:
199502042400=199502050000.‘0000’ is usually the preferred notation for midnight and not
‘2400’.
If a date and a time are displayed on the same line, then always write the date in front of the time.
Example: 19951231235959 is December 31, 1995 at 1 second before midnight.

Appendix II (B) Time zone
The syntax is ‘CCYYMMDDHHMMSS.UUUU[+|-ZZzz]’ where digits can be omitted from the right side to
express less precision.
Note: The Z stands for the ‘zero meridian’, which goes through Greenwich in London. Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC) was called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, also known as ‘Zulu Time’) prior to
1972; however, GMT should no longer be used.
The strings +ZZzz, or +ZZ can be added to the time to indicate that the used local time zone is ZZ
hours and zz minutes ahead of UTC. For time zones west of the zero meridian, which are behind UTC,
the notation –ZZzz, or –zz is used instead.
When transmitting across the time zone, use this indicator to ensure no confusion about future dates.
Example: 200509211242-08 is 12:42 pm (in the time zone that is 8 hours before UTC) on
September 21, 2005.

Appendix III (B) glossary of terms
This section identifies the vocabulary sets referenced within the message, including both those
vocabularies already defined and those which are still under development.
In addition, there are many different terms used to describe basic concepts in healthcare available
from various national and international organisations. For the purposes of this document, the following
terms and definitions apply to facilitate conformance and interoperability for regulatory reporting of
adverse events for human pharmaceuticals.
Term

Definition

Adverse Event

Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse
event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational)
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational)
product (see the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management:
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting).[ICHE6(R1)]

Acknowledgement Message

The acknowledgement message is an EDI Message with the

(ICSRACK)

information on the result of the acknowledgement of receipt
procedure to acknowledge the receipt of one safety message and the
safety report(s) contained in the safety file.[EMA]

Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)

In the pre-approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product
or its new usages, particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) cannot be
established: all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal
product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug
reactions. The phrase ‘responses to a medicinal product’ means that a
causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event
is at least a reasonable possibility, e.g. the relationship cannot be
ruled out.
Regarding marketed medicinal products: a response to a drug which
is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in
man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases or for
modification of physiological function (See the ICH Guideline for
Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for
Expedited Reporting).[ICHE6(R1)]

Case

An observation requiring investigation, and includes problems that
might or might not involve individual or groups of investigative
subjects.[HL7 Patient Safety]

Counterfeit Medicine

A medicine which is deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled with
respect to identity and/or source. Counterfeiting can apply to both
branded and generic products and counterfeit products can include
products with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients,
without active ingredients, with insufficient active ingredients or with
fake packaging.[WHO]
